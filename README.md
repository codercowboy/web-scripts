Basic Instructions
==================

This is a small collection of various utility scripts I've written over the years. There's some javascript, some php, and so on. 

I tend to make personal sites with wordpress, but if I'm going even simpler, I'll just use a php script or two to generate some static html with a simple build script. There's random things a coder needs sometimes, and occasionally finding something that's just right on the web can be more difficult than just looking at a few examples and rolling something on your own. 

If you're interested in learning about coding in php or javascript, I have a list of programming resources links that I update every so often, they may help you:

If you have any questions, comments, kudos, criticisms about any of the scripts, e-mail me. 

What the scripts do
===================

* Write Variable To File - helps developers snapshot (or serialize..) the current state of php objects (or primitives..) into php initialization code.
* WWS Mailer - lets visitors contact you through your website, while hiding your e-mail address.
* WWS Background Scaler - scales background images to fit the entire browser window without repeating the image.

Licensing
=========

All scripts are licensed with the [Apache license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_license), which is a great license because, essentially it:
* a) covers liability - my code should work, but I'm not liable if you do something stupid with it
* b) allows you to copy, fork, and use the code, even commercially
* c) is [non-viral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_license), that is, your derivative code doesn't *have to be* open source to use it

Other great licensing options for your own code: the BSD License, or the MIT License.
